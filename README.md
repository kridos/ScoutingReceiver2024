# FRC Crescendo Receiver

## Project Overview

The Crescendo Receiver is a desktop application (or web-based interface) designed as a companion to the Crescendo Scout mobile app for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Crescendo Season (2024). Its primary function is to efficiently scan QR codes generated by the mobile app, compile the collected scouting data, and display it in an organized, centralized table for in-depth analysis and strategic decision-making.

## Features

* **QR Code Scanning:** Capable of scanning QR codes generated by the Crescendo Scout mobile app to import team-specific scouting data.

* **Data Compilation & Storage:** Aggregates data from multiple scanned QR codes, storing it in a centralized location for easy access.

* **Tabular Data Display:** Presents all collected scouting information in a clear, sortable, and comprehensive table format, facilitating quick analysis.

* **Real-time Updates:** (If applicable) Displays data as it's scanned, providing immediate insights during competition.

* **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use by FRC team members for quick data review.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** The core programming languages for the receiver's interface.

* **QR Code Scanning Library:** `html5-qrcode` (for efficient QR code scanning).

* **Data Storage:** Local browser storage (for persistent data compilation and access).

## My Contributions

* Developed the core functionality for scanning and parsing QR code data.

* Designed and implemented the user interface for displaying compiled scouting data in a tabular format.

* Built the data management logic for storing, updating, and retrieving scouting information.

* Ensured efficient data processing and presentation for strategic analysis.

## Associated Team

* **FRC Team 9450 (Velocity Raptors)**

## Related Project: Crescendo Scout Mobile App

This receiver application is an integral part of a larger scouting ecosystem. It works in conjunction with the **Crescendo Scout Mobile App**, which is used by team members to collect scouting data offline and generate the QR codes.
